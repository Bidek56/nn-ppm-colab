Model is based on [Jiawei “David” Zhang](https://cfe.columbia.edu/files/seasieor/DavidZhang_Slides.pdf) research 

Significant portion of the code is based on [nn-ppm-model](https://github.com/yurit04/nn-ppm-model)

Data used for this model can be obtained from [FNMA](https://capmrkt.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/mbs/index.html)
